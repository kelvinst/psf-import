# psf-import

This project is a plugin with another way to import project set files.

### Why?

Cause I wanted to! No, no. Cause that old one from Eclipse don't make me happy enough. The idea is make the import of team project set files more advanced, keeping it easy to configure.

### How?

That is just an Eclipse plugin, no secrets :smiley:

### Contributors?

Only me, Kelvin Stinghen, for now, feel welcome to be another one!
